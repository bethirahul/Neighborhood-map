# My Neighborhood Map

This is my Neighborhood map _(web app)_, built by _**Rahul Bethi**_.

It shows some of the places I love in _Bay area, California_.

It uses [**Google maps API**](https://developers.google.com/maps/) to show a customized map, with my favorite places as markers on the map. Click the markers to get more info of the places. Google Street view near the place. [**Foursquare API**](https://developer.foursquare.com/) is used to get more info about Caf√©s. All these places can be searched and filtered by category.

This app uses a **PostgreSQL database** and **Python server** to get the places in JSON format. It then processes this data and shows them as markers on the map.
